            <h2 class="display-2">Introduction and Themes</h2>
            <p class="lead">Tradition and change: these concepts are opposites, yet both play prominent roles in the novel <em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife </em>by novelist Amy Tan and the short story &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; by Alice Walker. While &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; follows two different narratives in preserving heritage&mdash;one through preserving its materialistic values, and one for its ideal purpose&mdash;<em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife </em>follows a perspective where heritage ages and is destroyed, but no preservation can place at all&mdash;only watching. Throughout these works of literature, two fictional characters convey tradition and change at its best and worst. In the story &ldquo;Everyday Use,&rdquo; Dee showcases change at its worst, her possessive and domineering attitude only distances herself from her mother and traditional values, but tradition at its best, through both the monetary and sentimental value of an antique quilt. However, <em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife</em> showcases the natural evolution of tradition into a stronger individual, and embraces change. Winnie, the protagonist in the novel, begins unsteadily with little knowledge about family or intimacy, but has no choice to mature as she marries to an abusive husband and experiences war first-hand. The resulting strength she garners allows her to break free of societal expectations, move to America, and finally, carve her own path and culture for her family. Let&rsquo;s go find out more about <em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife </em>and &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; in their usage of archetypes, and contrast the two different stories.

            <h2 class="display-2">Archetypes</h2>
            <h2>Proto-Feminist Hero - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife</em></h2>
            <p class="lead">Winnie is a female, and thereby a proto-feminist hero. Her adventures in spite of certain discrimination highlights and even defies the gender equality problems of her time. Women were subservient to males in the social hierarchy of the Confucianist era, which resulted in Wen Fu dominating over Winnie in almost all of their decisions. </p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Threshold - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife </em>+ &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo;</h2>
            <p class="lead " >Winnie crosses the threshold when she sees Wen Fu for the first time, which is when she thought Wen Fu is &ldquo;very handsome [and she]... should marry him&rdquo; (Tan 202). Without this event, this story would not have happened at all, as Wen Fu is what allows Winnie to leave her previous life with Peanut. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead" >The threshold for Dee, a minor character in the short story, is when she goes to school in Augusta to learn more about her historical roots. Now, in the story, she has become &ldquo;Wangero,&rdquo; and, immersed in her African heritage, she now views her family as foreigners, even going so far as to &ldquo;stoop[ing] down quickly and lines up picture after picture of [Mama] sitting there in front of the house with Maggie cowering behind [her]&rdquo; (Walker 3). By doing so, Dee shows how far school has isolated her from her family, further showing the theme of traditional ideas vs the materialistic values. </p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Supernatural Intervention - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife </em></h2>
            <p class="lead" >Winnie believes in gods and deities. In this example, Winnie drops a pair of scissors, which then results in her baby&rsquo;s death, as soon after she dropped her scissors, &ldquo;the baby did not move even once&hellip; of course, it was already too late&rdquo; at the hospital (Tan 393). Later in the story, Winnie knocks over an entire table of scissors. As soon as she gets home, Hulan jumps &ldquo;up, put her hands to her mouth, and told [Winnie] to hurry and go to the hospital. &lsquo;Accident!&rsquo; she crie[s]. &lsquo;Wen Fu is hurt very bad, maybe dying&rsquo;&rdquo; (Tan 402). Obviously, she believed both events to be caused by bad luck. Even though supernatural intervention is normally positive, in this case, it has a negative impact. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>The Ritual - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife</em></h2>
            <p class="lead" >Winnie&rsquo;s marriage to Wen Fu represents her steps into adulthood, despite still being innocent about sex and hopeful of her husband&rsquo;s family. A large dowry was provided, and Wen Fu gave money, as is customary for a marriage, exactly &ldquo;four thousand yuan&hellip; a large sum&hellip; the same as two thousand dollars in U.S. money&rdquo; (Tan 230). These steps towards marriage were common among all women, and those who did not obey would be cast out of society, just as Peanut and Winnie&rsquo;s mother were.</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Color: Yellow - &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; </h2>
            <p class="lead" >Dee&rsquo;s dress is a bright yellow, &ldquo;so loud it hurts [the narrator&rsquo;s] eyes. There are yellows and oranges enough to throw back the light of the sun&rdquo; (Walker 3). Yellow represents her educated background and &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo; In reality, however, she is only educated&mdash;not wise. Her desire to preserve culture, such as taking the quilts and parts from the churn, lies superficial to the narrator&rsquo;s deeper interpretations.</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Shapeshifter - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife </em>+ &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; </h2>
            <p class="lead" >Winnie&rsquo;s husband, Wen Fu, uses smiles and kind behavior to attract Winnie and Peanut, and buys &ldquo;things for Peanut and [Winnie], luxuries he saw [them] admire&hellip; he swept [them] off [their] feet&rdquo; (Tan 205). However, his family only wanted Winnie&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s influence, business, and money, and in truth had no good intentions. For example, as soon as Winnie and Wen Fu married, Wen Fu constantly began to sexually abuse her, forcing her to do things she did not want to.</p>
            <p class="lead" >Dee appears to be kind and described to be as &ldquo;sweet as a bird,&rdquo; but she is frequently displayed to domineering (Walker 5). She appears at Mama&rsquo;s house not to pay her a visit, but to obtain pieces of her heritage and salvage them for their monetary value. Clearly, Dee knows exactly what she wants. She uses her outer appearance to mask her inner desires, ultimately revealing her shapeshifter form.</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Crossroads - <em>The Kitchen God's Wife</em></h2>
            <p class="lead" >Winnie faces a crossroads when the servant girl tells her she was raped by Wen Fu. Despite remaining silent about the incident for several weeks, Winnie decides to confront him after the servant girl dies, coming to a realization that if she does not do anything about the incident, she will be dishonored. She shouts that he &ldquo;pushed that girl down, ruined her life, who knows how many others&rdquo; and eventually, her arguing proves to be a reckless decision. Wen Fu, in his fury, hits Yiku, hurting his own daughter mentally and physically. Winnie dares not to defy her husband when around her children now, and Yiku &ldquo;curl[s] herself up small&hellip; suck[ing] her fingers, making little sounds&rdquo; (Tan 427). </p>

          <h2 class="display-2 text-center">Contrasting Themes</h2>
          <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
            <h3>While the stories find common ground in their subjects of tradition, there is little between their intents&mdash;whereas <em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife </em>embraces the natural evolution and change of heritage over time, &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; rejects it outright, and chooses instead to depict the vying of two perspectives to prevent it entirely. Thus, although both works focus on the same themes and conflict between change and tradition, <strong><em>in Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife</em></strong><strong>, the embracing of change is given precedence over tradition, while in &ldquo;Everyday Use&rdquo; the case is vice versa. </strong></h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4">
          <h3>Evolving Heritage (<i>The Kitchen God's Wife</i>)</h3>
          <h4>Watching Tradition be Destroyed</h4>
          &nbsp;
          <p class="lead">Unlike <em>Everyday Use</em>, Winnie is not in a position to preserve her heritage. Instead of seeking ways to protect her family belongings and continue their traditions, she is forced to watch them be completely shattered at the hands of age and Wen Fu&rsquo;s evil family. </p>
          &nbsp;
          <h4>An Uplifting Perspective for Change:</h4>
          <p class="lead">Now, help me light three sticks of incense. The smoke will take our wishes to heaven&hellip; oh, even faster when we laugh, lifting our hopes, higher and higher...&rdquo; (Tan 532).</p>
          <p class="lead">The decades of suffering and hundreds of pages of storytelling are finally brought to fruition in a pure and tangible form: the gift that Winnie presents to Pearl. However, it is far from representing the suffering the Kitchen God&rsquo;s wife endured; rather, it is a goddess with a true woman&rsquo;s power, Lady Sorrowfree. She is the ultimate blend of all of Winnie&rsquo;s lessons from both tradition and modern times. This milestone marks where she has come to peace with her past and her daughter&rsquo;s path to come, where changes are thoroughly embraced and the evolution of their heritage to continue on.</p>
          <h4>Tradition being lost</h4>
          <p class="lead">I took a soft cloth and dipped it in water, washed her face&hellip; I washed harder and harder. And soon I saw what I had done: rubbed half her face off completely! I cried, as if I had killed her&hellip; I did not even have a painting anymore to call my mother.(Tan 104).</p>
          <p class="lead">The series of tragedies in <em>The Kitchen God&rsquo;s Wife</em> shatter&rsquo;s Winnie&rsquo;s connection to her heritage. The blemishing of her mother&rsquo;s picture, as well as the many other misdeeds that eventually ruin her family household, unrecognizably change her circumstances. However, not all of these changes are bad, and as seen through Lady Sorrowfree, she learns that there are many she should embrace in hoping for a better future for her family.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-4">
          <h3>Preserving Heritage’s Materialistic Values vs. Ideal Purpose (Everyday Use)</h3>
          <h4>Preserving Tradition</h4>
          <p class="lead">Unlike <i>The Kitchen God’s Wife</i>, the conflict between the narrator and Dee is almost completely idealistic: one desires to preserve its materialistic value, while the other preserves its idealistic purpose.</p>
          <h4>A Satirical View for Change:</h4>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="lead">“‘Hang them,’ she said. As if that was the only thing you could do with quilts” (Walker 6).</p></blockquote>
          <p class="lead">Dee’s proposed alternative to hang quilts for display rather than use them “normally” for everyday use amuses the narrator. Unlike in Tan’s work, there is only “change” proposed in this novel and it is not a welcome one; in fact, it is portrayed in a vastly negative light and an insult to the narrator’s heritage. Thus, instead of depicting the natural evolution of heritage, here, change is outright rejected, and the novel ends on a bittersweet note.</p>
          
          <h4>Tradition being found</h4>
          <p class="lead">An appreciation and desire to uphold the preservation of tradition:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="lead">“‘I reckon she would,’I said. “God knows I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope she will!’” (Walker 6).</p></blockquote>
          <p class="lead">While Dee believes she can preserve tradition through preserving the quilt’s physical form, the narrator believes that its continued use as an everyday item, rather than an artifact, is the way things ought to be. As we see through the conclusion of the novel with her victory, it is clear that the narrator has a greater touch with her heritage. However, because both characters place emphasis on continuing and preserving tradition, no motif could be clearer or more fitting than tradition being found.</p>
